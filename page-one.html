    <h1>It's a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six level of headings.</p>
    <h1>"H1"</h1>
    <h2>"H2"</h2>
    <h3>"H3"</h3>
    <h4>"H4"</h4>
    <h5>"H5"</h5>
    <h6>"H6"</h6>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <h3>Unordered List</h3>
    <p>This is how you make Unordered List</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item on its own "li" element.</li>
        <li>They don't need to be any particular order.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ordered List</h3>
      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>"ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>this is an ordered list.</li>
        <li>list item numbers increment on their own.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
      <h4>Emphasis (Italic) Elements</h4>
      <p>"p" is a block level element, while "em" is an inline element that affects the a span of text inside of a paragraph.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you need to draw <em>attention</em> to a particular word.</p>
      <h3>Strong (Bold) Elements</h3>
      <p>Sometimes we need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
      <h3>Structure Vs Presentation</h3>
      <p>You might be wondering why we’re using the terms “emphasis” and “strong” instead of “italic” and “bold”. That brings us to an important distinction between HTML and CSS. HTML markup should provide semantic information about your content—not presentational information. In other words, HTML should define the structure of your document, leaving its appearance to CSS.</p>
      <p>The pseudo-obsolete "b" and "i" elements are classic examples of this. They used to stand for “bold” and “italic”, respectively, but HTML5 attempted to create a clear separation between a document’s structure and its presentation. Thus, "i" was replaced with "em", since emphasized text can be displayed in all sorts of ways aside from being italicized (e.g., in a different font, a different color, or a bigger size). Same for "b" and "strong".</p>
      <h3>Empty HTML Elements</h3>
      <h5>Line Breaks</h5>
      <p>To tell the browser that we want a hard line break <br/>, we need to use an explicit "br" element</p>
      <h5>Horizontal Rules</h5>
      <p>The "hr" element is a “horizontal rule”, which represents a thematic break like below</p>
      <hr/>
      <br/>

      <h5>Optional Trailing Slash(/) </h5>
      <p>The trailing slash (/) in all empty HTML elements is entirely optional.</p>
      <h5>Links And Images</h5>
