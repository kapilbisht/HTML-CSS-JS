    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>Unlike all the HTML elements we’ve encountered so far, image content is defined outside of the web page that renders it. Fortunately for us, we already have a way to refer to external resources from within an HTML document: absolute, relative, and root-relative URLs.</p>

    <h4>Text Alternatives</h4>
    <p>Adding "alt" attributes to your "img" elements is a best practice. It defines a “text alternative” to the image being displayed. This has an impact on both search engines and users with text-only browsers (e.g., people that use text-to-speech software due to a vision impairment).</p>
    <h4>Image Formats</h4>

    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt="A mochi ball in a bubble"/>

    <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.gif' alt="A dancing mochi ball"/>

    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.png' alt="A mochi ball"/>

    <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
    <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt="A mochi ball with Bezier handles"/>
