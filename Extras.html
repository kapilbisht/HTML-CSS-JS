    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>An “HTML entity” is a special character that can’t be represented as plain text in an HTML document. This typically either means it’s a reserved character in HTML or you don’t have a key on your keyboard for it.</p>
    <h4>Reserved Characters</h4>
    <p>The <, >, and & characters are called “reserved characters” because they aren’t allowed to be inserted into an HTML document without being encoded. This is because they mean something in the HTML syntax: "<" begins a new tag, ">" ends a tag, and, as we’re about to learn, & sets off an HTML entity.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>

    <h4>Quotes</h4>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
   yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
